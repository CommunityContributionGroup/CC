Introduction:
A time series is a set of observations with each one being recorded at a specific time. Forecasting time series have different methods, such as recursive prediction algorithms, Durbin-Levinson algorithm and innovations algorithms.

This Cheatsheet is about ITSMR package. It contains functions for modeling and forecasting time series data and uses innovations algorithms for forecasting variance. ITSMR includes five methods for estimating ARMA parameters: Yule-Walker, Burg, Hannan-Rissanen, maximum likelihood, and the innovations method.
